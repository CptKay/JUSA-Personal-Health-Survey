We started taking the brief apart and started with our own hand sketches as seen on Figma.
We talked most like about the way it could be done and choose a way to do it.
First we talked about version 1 11 page, each question a page. It is tempting to make the 3page version as well
We finished the step according to the Trello
We had some inputs and started from scratch, at first it went well. 
Then the first problem came up with the breadcrumbs how to automate it.
We crated a Figma mock up with a flowchart on page 2 in Figma
we share all the work with Samy doing a little Figma and Jules
We split up the page and made 3 segment ( Range slide Radio button Input field)
after trying to validate the field per PHP and failed, we were starting to use the HTML requirement and HTML way to do it.
Many functions we lost too much time, so we just use what we could get working.
With pretty print we saw the answer mach the values of the $_SESSION array and kept going
to find out how to some the score, we rush and use a lot of time on that.
In the last day we try to fix up the page as good as possible and also had many try and errors
trying to get the right php script working if it worked we implement it, if not we keep on what we have.
we have an understanding of how it should be done in a right way and manner, but simply ran out of the time to do it the right way with functionality. We worked in both agreement together and have both and understanding and if we would invest more time in the project we eventually could do it in the right PHP manner. We give thanks to the opportunity Team for this challenge and are grateful of the advice given from Brandon Chris and Anita. Until the next Code Best Regards Jules and Samy
