26. Jules found a description and will try it out to sum the result
link:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/48164167/php-arrays-in-array-sum-value-by-specific-key


27. there was a message about that no variable was defined
28. Jules try to add a variable
29. it seems to work
30. fail :Fatal error: Uncaught Type Error: Unsupported operand types: int + string 
31. As Jules try to get access to the answer value, Jules complete failed by forgetting that it is all in the $_SESSION. 
33. Reading about the filter things in the session.
34. playing around with methods from links like
(1.:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59721589/php-array-sum-values
2.:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/16138395/sum-values-of-multidimensional-array-by-key-without-loop
3.:https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13693840/find-sum-of-all-keys-in-session-array)
the third instruction and the hint of Sven helped out.

35. Save the working function and move on to the next, make it look good!

36. I wished we could play more around with the PHP option of validating, but there was not enough time for that, need to spend more hours in my study time. 

37. im trying to clean the code without breaking the PHP function.
38. we are working on the responsive, Sammy is working on the code for the breadcrumb, so we could actually put in the head. So it wouldn't be manual
Jules is working on page 4 radio button responsive.
39. Jules Is working now on the responsive from page 5
40. Page 5 responsive
41. creating button at the result page to start again
42.the question section is identical now
43.There are many stuff we didnt get to work as we want it to so i consider this version as a prototype
44.Samy made progress with the breadcrumbs. Save in his Branch.
